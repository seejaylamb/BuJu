  –  CURRENT SPRINT - EHS PI.25.3.AUG.29 - 5 (09.01) 

>  create defect for error message when changing Emp ID - recreated in TESTAUTOMA - only try recreate on stage

  •  look into test cases from sprint 4 without test cases - update spreadsheet
	- shared excel with Patrickkkkk



  –  (?) story https://lmsportal.atlassian.net/browse/EHS-16844 - Maybe CT team can provide a testcase they have for this one? Otherwsise I can't see that it was tested by our team.
(?) story https://lmsportal.atlassian.net/browse/EHS-16635 - Looks like it skipped right to UAT (no QA). From the subtasks QA planned to have some time with this so would like to followup on this one.
(?) bug https://lmsportal.atlassian.net/browse/EHS-11568 - Tested by Gabe, and has evidence in the comments, but I think this one needs a testcase one way or another. Lets add a task to this sprint?
(/) bug https://lmsportal.atlassian.net/browse/EHS-16681 - this looks like a datafix. Doesn't look like QA was involved in it, so marked it as dev-test-testcase-no. Let me know if the team prefers a different label for this type of thing.
There were a couple others that were justified in other ways (duplicate, cancelled, just needed a link added from the source ticket)
 

  X  flip ISTESTSSO to zitadel stage
  X  close current QA subtasks from Sprint 4
 
  X  add QA subtasks for sprint 5
  •  work on test plans for sprint 5
  
•  if help needed with OKTA or Duo Mobile ask general Vector IT.
